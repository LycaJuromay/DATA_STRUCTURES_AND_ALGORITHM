# DATA_STRUCTURES_AND_ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION 
## What does my program do? 
- This program is bound to plot and show the graph of the result of different mathematical expressions/problems inside, base on what the user chooses/inputs for this program to plot.

## Some Functions and Methods:
*•matplotlib.pyplot* - used so that the program is able to provide a plot of results.
*•'r'- read*-is used to read the input file "SB.txt" to access the values of x
*•'w'- write* - is used to write or save the results to a new file.
*•"SB.txt"* - file consists of numbers from 1—50, which are the x values
*•"OP().txt"*- output file for results 
*•def plotDisplay():* - variable is being defined
*•plt.plot(prob2(), "g-"* ,label="Problem 2")
*•plt.xlabel("Value of X")* – label x 'axis 
*•plt.ylabel("Answer")* –  label y axis as Answer
*•plt.show()* - shows the plot
*•plotDisplay()*- display the graph

>>>>>>>>>>>
***The program shows,first, the list of all options where the user could choose a number to input, and after the user enters their input (from numbers 1-11) the program then reads an input file(SB.txt), replace the x in the expressions with the value of numbers from the txt file. After that the program solves the math expression, saves /writes the result to a new file or output file(OP1.txt) then plots the result of the chosen mathematical expression, with the numbers from SB.txt file as Value of X and the result as Y.
>>>>>>>>>>>The program has options from 1-10 which shows individual graphs of each results, and the option 11 to show the graph for all the results from problems 1 to 10.***
